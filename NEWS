dconf-editor 3.26.1
=====================

Long time since last release, with some little but interesting changes, and many
translations updates. First, there is now a toggle on boolean rows for switching
faster the key value. In the same spirit, integer keys that only accepts a small
range of values now can be directly changed, from the right-click popover. There
is also a shortcut for reseting a key to its default value.

dconf-editor 3.23.4
=====================

The bigger change is the switch to modern Gettext for translations of XML files,
in place of the deprecated Intltool. That came with a cleaning of Autotools code
–let’s hope I didn't break things here or there. Also, Unicode is now used where
needed in every translatable english string. There're some small changes in keys
description presentation, but more to come on the topic in this cycle.

dconf-editor 3.22.3
=====================

Little code changes, that's probably the last release of the gnome-3-22 branch.

Translations updated:
  Italian: Gianvito Cavasoli
  Norwegian bokmål: Kjartan Maraas
  Slovak: Peter Mráz
  Tajik: Victor Ibragimov

dconf-editor 3.22.1
=====================

Appdata installation has been fixed, and the theming support has been improved.

Translations updated:
  Slovak: Dušan Kazik

dconf-editor 3.22.0
=====================

The appdata file validation has been changed to work without hacks (but... isn't
that a hack?). Hopefully, all should be good now for a new great stable release!

Translations updated:
  Basque: Inaki Larranaga Murgoitio
  Danish: Kenneth Nielsen
  Polish: Piotr Drąg
  Swedish: Anders Jonsson

dconf-editor 3.21.92
=====================

The keyboard navigation has been improved, and various a11y and i18n bugs have
been fixed. Also, dconf-editor should now be able to compile with the valac flag
--enable-experimental-non-null, reducing the number of potential code errors.

dconf-editor 3.21.90
=====================

Mainly polished the new UI, including improving keyboard navigation and updating
some metadatas. Looks quite good for an exciting new stable release, but please,
test! :)

  British English: David King
  Czech: Marek Černocký

dconf-editor 3.21.4
=====================

The UI has completely evolved, into an all-in-one-window. That permits notably a
"delay mode" in which multiple changes are applied at the same time (only schema
by schema when there're some, and other keys via a DConfChangeset). Keys without
schema can also be deleted now.

dconf-editor 3.21.1
=====================

Some nullable variables are more correctly checked.

dconf-editor 3.20.2
=====================

The english wording of the welcome dialog has (again) been improved, and a bug
appearing when closing the application with the app-menu has been corrected.

Translations updated:
  Polish: Piotr Drąg
  Swedish: Anders Jonsson

dconf-editor 3.20.1
=====================

An english typo has been corrected in the welcome dialog, and translations files
have been updated accordingly.

Translations updated:
  Esperanto: Kristjan Schmidt
  Finnish: Jiri Grönroos
  Greek: Tom Tryfonidis

dconf-editor 3.20.0
=====================

All is looking good in this new 3.20 stable release with so many great changes!
Let’s hope everybody will like this new UI, clearer and more accessible.

  Danish: Ask Hjorth Larsen
  Greek: Tom Tryfonidis
  Italian: Milo Casagrande
  Swedish: Sebastian Rasmussen
  Turkish: Muhammet Kara

dconf-editor 3.19.92
=====================

Some problems have appeared related to the sizing of the key-editor dialogs, and
will need more testing with a clean Gtk+ release, even if all looks corrected.
An infinite loop has also be spotted when trying to reset all keys of a folder
containing keys without schema. Also, a CSS resource with one rule only has been
added to look better when using the “Big Text” accessibility feature.

dconf-editor 3.19.91
=====================

Only one code change for this second beta release: the presentation of a key’s
“default value” now takes care of distributor and admin overrides, instead of
showing the default value proposed in the gschema. Ideally, we should show the
two informations, but this one is more logical to present with the current UI.

dconf-editor 3.19.90
=====================

This release has seen some improvements to the keyboard usability, with some new
shortcuts added, and an help overlay to document them (requiring a GTK+ 3.19 at
least). Other changes include some more metadata in the AppData file (used by
software centers to know about the application), and minor corrections caused by
recent GTK+ changes.

dconf-editor 3.19.3
=====================

Added a notification for the multiple “copy” actions, and a new menu for actions
on the view (notably a “reset visible keys” action – no recursion for now).

Translations updated:
 Portuguese (Pedro Albuquerque)
 Spanish (Daniel Mustieles)
 Slovak (Dušan Kazik)
 Kazakh (Baurzhan Muftakhidinov)

dconf-editor 3.19.2
=====================

Removed an unnecessary big hack, and improved some other little things here and
there. A new Occitan translation, and some translations updates –many thanks to
all people who helped– as the new UI has more strings.

 Romanian (Kalev Lember)
 Occitan (Cédric Valmary; new translation)
 Hungarian (Balázs Meskó)
 Portuguese (Pedro Albuquerque)

dconf-editor 3.19.1
=====================

Many big changes. First, dconf-editor is now distributed under GPL 3. Secondly,
it now uses GSettingsSchema to access schemas informations, and GSettings to
edit settings when that’s possible. Thirdly, the UI of the keys list has been
updated to use a GtkListBox, more accessible, more usable, cleaner. And many
other things already done (and more to come).

 Finnish (Jiri Grönroos)
 Czech (Marek Černocký)
 Romanian (Daniel Șerbănescu)
 Galician (Fran Dieguez)

dconf-editor 3.18.0
=====================

Neither change nor new critical bug since the last beta, so here comes 3.18.0.
This cycle has seen some UI and code cleaning, requiring Gtk+ 3.14 notably, but
without real technical evolution (planed for next stable release).

Thanks to all people who helped coding and translating this project.

dconf-editor 3.17.92
=====================

Translation updated:
 Persian

dconf-editor 3.17.91
=====================

The output of --version is now printed on stdout, as suggested by GNU. That's the only technical change, all looks good.

Translations updated:
 Polish
 Chinese (Taiwan)

dconf-editor 3.17.90
=====================

No big technical change for the beta, just some preparations for the next cycle.

Translations updated:
 Swedish
 Portuguese

dconf-editor 3.17.1
=====================

Beginning of cleaning, both of the code (UI template, GResource…) and of the UI
(unnecessary shadows removed, widgets' margins, minimum width of the panel…).
Gtk+ 3.14 is now required, with also a recent Valac.

dconf-editor 3.16.1
=====================

Little update that adds a symbolic icon, displayed in GNOME Shell's top-bar and
when using the high contrast theme.

Translations updated:
 Latvian
 Icelandic
 Norwegian (bokmål)

dconf-editor 3.16.0
=====================

First stable release of dconf-editor as a standalone module! Since the Release
Candidate, there has only been translations updates.

dconf-editor 3.15.92
=====================

The main correction since 3.15.91 is the add back of the manpage, forgotten
during the split. Because of that, dconf 0.23.2 is now explicitely required.
The AppData file also validates again.

dconf-editor 3.15.91
