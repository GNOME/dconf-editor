dconf-editor 3.18.0
=====================

Neither change nor new critical bug since the last beta, so here comes 3.18.0.
This cycle has seen some UI and code cleaning, requiring Gtk+ 3.14 notably, but
without real technical evolution (planed for next stable release).

Thanks to all people who helped coding and translating this project.

dconf-editor 3.17.92
=====================

Translation updated:
 Persian

dconf-editor 3.17.91

The output of --version is now printed on stdout, as suggested by GNU. That's the only technical change, all looks good.

 Chinese (Taiwan)

dconf-editor 3.17.90
=====================

No big technical change for the beta, just some preparations for the next cycle.

Translations updated:
 Swedish
 Portuguese

dconf-editor 3.17.1
=====================

Beginning of cleaning, both of the code (UI template, GResource…) and of the UI
(unnecessary shadows removed, widgets' margins, minimum width of the panel…).
Gtk+ 3.14 is now required, with also a recent Valac.

dconf-editor 3.16.1
=====================

Little update that adds a symbolic icon, displayed in GNOME Shell's top-bar and
when using the high contrast theme.

Translations updated:

dconf-editor 3.16.0

First stable release of dconf-editor as a standalone module! Since the Release
Candidate, there has only been translations updates.

dconf-editor 3.15.92
=====================

The main correction since 3.15.91 is the add back of the manpage, forgotten
during the split. Because of that, dconf 0.23.2 is now explicitely required.
The AppData file also validates again.
