dconf-editor 3.28.0
=====================

All looks good for a new stable release. Many changes in the UI, many changes in
the backend, some real improvements that –I hope– will please every user of this
3.28 release. Needs to be highlighted, the rework of the list of keys look, some
fixes in the backend with notably the support of relocatable schemas (a function
that was asked regularly) and a refresh of the schema list, and a first revision
of an improved search function.

dconf-editor 3.27.92
=====================

Small fixes of corner cases, it looks good for a clean release. I’m just annoyed
by the impossibility of opening a path from command-line when in a Flatpack, but
I don’t consider this packaging format as supported for now, so fixes will come.

dconf-editor 3.27.91
=====================

Random schedule is random, that’s a beta release. :) I didn’t publish 3.27.4, as
it would have needed a Gtk+ 3.22.27 release and as there was so many big changes
planned in the code that releasing a snapshot would have been quite meaningless.
So have a look also to the 3.27.4 news!

As planned, the code changed a lot this last month, and that will help in future
developments; but that is not visible to the user of course. There has been many
attention given to details, like hiding boolean switches from keys list when the
delay mode is activated, ensuring all ellipsize correctly, selecting the current
row when entering search mode, etc. Schemas containing neither keys nor children
are not displayed anymore but emit a warning at application startup instead. The
transitions also look smooth using HighContrast theme.

The big thing is probably the handling of multiple schemas installed at the same
path, and the new keys list organisation by schema. The first looks certainly as
a corner-case, but not handling that was a sad proof of the fragility of the way
the application was displaying keys, and I’m happy it’s now fixed. The second is
possibly something that will help a bit users to understand the structure of the
settings internals, and that’s always a good thing. Sorting folders first option
has been of course removed, as that’s the default now.

Hope we’re good now for an incredible 3.28 release in March! :)

dconf-editor 3.27.4
=====================

Various UI improvements, including icons next to edited keys, and the limitation
of the content in infobar. The underlying model has also been improved a little.
The experimental code that was causing crashes in some build conditions has been
removed. Also, the actions that were accessible via dbus have been made private.
The command-line has been a little bit reworked, with an experimental completion
available, and the manpage updated.

dconf-editor 3.27.3
=====================

Big release. There’s a new developer, Davi da Silva Böger, and things are moving
faster, finally. Great. :)

The main UI has been redesigned. The search is now dynamic and looks great; even
if search results could be improved, this function will probably already be more
useful than what was there previously. Relocatable schemas are now handled; that
has been possible by adding an internal list of known mappings, and offering the
user a settings to add custom ones. Please, test.

Some little more things for users: the “back” and “forward” buttons of mice that
have some could now be used; you can now open dconf-editor to a given path or to
the path where a given schema is mapped using command-line; there’s an option to
sort folder first (or last); HighContrast theme has been tested with new design;
edition of values of type “double” is fixed; keys of the “string array” type are
not anymore edited with a single-line entry; etc.

As you can imagine, many things have changed internally. This release includes a
(recently pushed) patch known to break the handling of some corner-cases; if you
hit one of these, please report bug, it will help. And other changes are coming.

Packagers should be aware also that the gettext domain changed, and that there’s
a patch included that has been reported to make the build in some quite specific
conditions crashy; if you are in this situation, please comment on the bugzilla.

dconf-editor 3.27.1
=====================

The main change in this (unstable) release is the switch from Autotools to Meson
for a faster build. Thanks for testing and reporting every bug that’s related to
this important change (or to any other thing :) of course). And you can now open
dconf-editor to a path given on the commandline.

dconf-editor 3.26.1
=====================

Long time since last release, with some little but interesting changes, and many
translations updates. First, there is now a toggle on boolean rows for switching
faster the key value. In the same spirit, integer keys that only accepts a small
range of values now can be directly changed, from the right-click popover. There
is also a shortcut for reseting a key to its default value.

dconf-editor 3.23.4
=====================

The bigger change is the switch to modern Gettext for translations of XML files,
in place of the deprecated Intltool. That came with a cleaning of Autotools code
–let’s hope I didn't break things here or there. Also, Unicode is now used where
needed in every translatable english string. There're some small changes in keys
description presentation, but more to come on the topic in this cycle.

dconf-editor 3.22.3

Little code changes, that's probably the last release of the gnome-3-22 branch.

Translations updated:
  Italian: Gianvito Cavasoli
  Norwegian bokmål: Kjartan Maraas
  Slovak: Peter Mráz

dconf-editor 3.22.1
=====================

Appdata installation has been fixed, and the theming support has been improved.

Translations updated:
  Slovak: Dušan Kazik

dconf-editor 3.22.0
=====================

The appdata file validation has been changed to work without hacks (but... isn't
that a hack?). Hopefully, all should be good now for a new great stable release!

Translations updated:
  Basque: Inaki Larranaga Murgoitio
  Danish: Kenneth Nielsen

dconf-editor 3.21.92
=====================

The keyboard navigation has been improved, and various a11y and i18n bugs have
been fixed. Also, dconf-editor should now be able to compile with the valac flag
--enable-experimental-non-null, reducing the number of potential code errors.

dconf-editor 3.21.90
=====================

Mainly polished the new UI, including improving keyboard navigation and updating
some metadatas. Looks quite good for an exciting new stable release, but please,
test! :)

dconf-editor 3.21.4
=====================

The UI has completely evolved, into an all-in-one-window. That permits notably a
"delay mode" in which multiple changes are applied at the same time (only schema
by schema when there're some, and other keys via a DConfChangeset). Keys without
schema can also be deleted now.

dconf-editor 3.21.1
=====================

Some nullable variables are more correctly checked.

dconf-editor 3.20.2
=====================

The english wording of the welcome dialog has (again) been improved, and a bug
appearing when closing the application with the app-menu has been corrected.

Translations updated:
  Polish: Piotr Drąg
  Swedish: Anders Jonsson

dconf-editor 3.20.1
=====================

An english typo has been corrected in the welcome dialog, and translations files
have been updated accordingly.

  Esperanto: Kristjan Schmidt

dconf-editor 3.20.0

Let’s hope everybody will like this new UI, clearer and more accessible.

dconf-editor 3.19.92
=====================

Some problems have appeared related to the sizing of the key-editor dialogs, and
will need more testing with a clean Gtk+ release, even if all looks corrected.
An infinite loop has also be spotted when trying to reset all keys of a folder
containing keys without schema. Also, a CSS resource with one rule only has been
added to look better when using the “Big Text” accessibility feature.

dconf-editor 3.19.91
=====================

Only one code change for this second beta release: the presentation of a key’s
“default value” now takes care of distributor and admin overrides, instead of
showing the default value proposed in the gschema. Ideally, we should show the
two informations, but this one is more logical to present with the current UI.

dconf-editor 3.19.90
=====================

This release has seen some improvements to the keyboard usability, with some new
shortcuts added, and an help overlay to document them (requiring a GTK+ 3.19 at
least). Other changes include some more metadata in the AppData file (used by
software centers to know about the application), and minor corrections caused by
recent GTK+ changes.

dconf-editor 3.19.3

Added a notification for the multiple “copy” actions, and a new menu for actions
on the view (notably a “reset visible keys” action – no recursion for now).

Translations updated:
 Portuguese (Pedro Albuquerque)
 Spanish (Daniel Mustieles)
 Slovak (Dušan Kazik)

dconf-editor 3.19.2
=====================

Removed an unnecessary big hack, and improved some other little things here and
there. A new Occitan translation, and some translations updates –many thanks to
all people who helped– as the new UI has more strings.

dconf-editor 3.19.1
=====================

Many big changes. First, dconf-editor is now distributed under GPL 3. Secondly,
it now uses GSettingsSchema to access schemas informations, and GSettings to
edit settings when that’s possible. Thirdly, the UI of the keys list has been
updated to use a GtkListBox, more accessible, more usable, cleaner. And many
other things already done (and more to come).

dconf-editor 3.18.0
=====================

Neither change nor new critical bug since the last beta, so here comes 3.18.0.
This cycle has seen some UI and code cleaning, requiring Gtk+ 3.14 notably, but
without real technical evolution (planed for next stable release).

Thanks to all people who helped coding and translating this project.

dconf-editor 3.17.92
=====================

Translation updated:
 Persian

dconf-editor 3.17.91
=====================

The output of --version is now printed on stdout, as suggested by GNU. That's the only technical change, all looks good.

Translations updated:
 Polish
 Chinese (Taiwan)

dconf-editor 3.17.90
=====================

No big technical change for the beta, just some preparations for the next cycle.

Translations updated:
 Swedish
 Portuguese

dconf-editor 3.17.1
=====================

Beginning of cleaning, both of the code (UI template, GResource…) and of the UI
(unnecessary shadows removed, widgets' margins, minimum width of the panel…).
Gtk+ 3.14 is now required, with also a recent Valac.

dconf-editor 3.16.1
=====================

Little update that adds a symbolic icon, displayed in GNOME Shell's top-bar and
when using the high contrast theme.

Translations updated:
 Latvian
 Icelandic
 Norwegian (bokmål)

dconf-editor 3.16.0
=====================

First stable release of dconf-editor as a standalone module! Since the Release
Candidate, there has only been translations updates.

dconf-editor 3.15.92
=====================

The main correction since 3.15.91 is the add back of the manpage, forgotten
during the split. Because of that, dconf 0.23.2 is now explicitely required.
The AppData file also validates again.

dconf-editor 3.15.91
