# Code of Conduct

The web-places where this application is developed –mainly on the GNOME Gitlab instance– try to be welcoming spaces. If you feel something is missing for reaching that goal, please open an issue about it or notify it to the maintainer. Also, note that the [GNOME Foundation code of conduct](https://wiki.gnome.org/Foundation/CodeOfConduct) applies there. Thanks.
