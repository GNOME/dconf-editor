msgstr[1] "%u dconf operations delayed."

#. Translators: Beginning of a sentence like "One gsettings operation and 2 dconf operations delayed.", you could duplicate "delayed" if needed, as it refers to both the gsettings and dconf operations (at least one of each).
#. Also, "gsettings" is a technical term, notably a shell command, so you probably should not translate it.

#. Translators: Second part (and end) of a sentence like "One gsettings operation and 2 dconf operations delayed.", so:
#. * the space before the "and" is probably wanted, and
#. * the "delayed" refers to both the gsettings and dconf operations (at least one of each).
#. Also, "dconf" is a technical term, notably a shell command, so you probably should not translate it.
